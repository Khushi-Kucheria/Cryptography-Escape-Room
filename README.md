## Game Description

This game simulates a digital escape room where players solve cryptographic puzzles in sequence. Each room introduces a new encryption scheme, with clues and hints guiding players to the solution. Successfully decrypt the ciphertext and enter the correct plaintext to advance to the next room ‚Äî until you finally escape!

This project is perfect for anyone looking to learn or practice basic cryptography concepts in a fun, interactive way.

## Gameplay Overview

- **Four rooms total**: Each with a distinct cryptographic puzzle.
- Players **read the ciphertext and key (if provided)**, then **decrypt** the message.
- The player inputs the decrypted text to unlock the next room.
- If the answer is incorrect, players get feedback and can request hints.
- The game provides multiple hints gradually to help beginners.

### Room 1: Caesar Cipher
- **Concept:** Shift each letter by a fixed number down the alphabet.
- **Ciphertext:** Letters shifted by a secret offset (e.g., +3).
- **Goal:** Reverse the shift to reveal the original message.
- **Hints:** Alphabet mapping, examples of letter shifts.

### Room 2: Vigen√®re Cipher
- **Concept:** A polyalphabetic cipher using a keyword to shift letters variably.
- **Ciphertext:** Letters shifted according to repeating key letters.
- **Goal:** Use the key to reverse shifts and reveal the original message.
- **Hints:** How the key is applied, letter shifting examples, and how to align key and ciphertext.

### Room 3: Mini RSA Decryption
- **Concept:** Public-key encryption with small primes (p=5, q=11).
- **Ciphertext:** Numeric ciphertext encoded via RSA.
- **Goal:** Use RSA decryption formula with provided primes to recover plaintext.
- **Hints:** RSA basics, modular arithmetic, how to find private key.

### Room 4: XOR Cipher (Mini AES XOR puzzle)
- **Concept:** Byte-wise XOR of ciphertext and key in hex form.
- **Ciphertext/Key:** Hexadecimal strings.
- **Goal:** XOR ciphertext bytes with key bytes to reveal ASCII plaintext.
- **Hints:** Binary/hex conversion, XOR operation truth table, ASCII mapping.
